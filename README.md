### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Trump's twitter tells us the other side of his speeches
+ This project is conducted by [Tongyue Liu]

+ Project summary: Seeing from the text mining results of the inaugral or nomination speeches from Trump, some of the results just surprised me a little. So I'm thinking of the reasons of that phenomenon. Maybe, that is because the official words or politely thankful words in the speeches affect the main attitude of Trump. 
So, I got the idea of using data from Twitters. Words on Twitter seem to be more true and reliable when analyzing for Trump.
